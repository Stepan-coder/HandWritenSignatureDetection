# Deep Learning based Signature Detection (YOLOv5x)
## Introduction

  In the modern, rapidly developing world, where all spheres of human life are actively digitized, the problem of interaction with a large number of documents is quite acute. Yes, in the XIX and XX century, the accountant's vacancy was considered fashionable and prestigious, because there were very few qualified specialists, and their work was evaluated quite highly. But times are changing, technologies are developing, and people are tired of doing the same type of work on their own. Therefore, by automating this process, it would be possible to save a significant amount of time and qualified resources. This project is part of a large system for obtaining named entities from documents.
